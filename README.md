# About this project

This is my site.

Anything that I commit to the main branch gets auto deployed. I want this to be
a project that's easy for me to work on iteratively â€“ quick, small changes,
deployed regularly.

My friend Sam inspired this approach. I decided to copy him after about 4
re-write attempts for my old site.

So, this project is written in Elixir, using Phoenix, hosted on Fly.io as these
are the tools I work with day-to-day. This is about removing barriers to making
updates and changes so that I can do work rather than fight with JS dependencies
breaking my tooling whenever I try to do something new. No bad vibes for the JS
ecosystem though! This is just about using tools that I use daily.
